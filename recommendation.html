This movie is the third installment in the series of 8 films. If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend watching the first movie beforehand to fully understand the story. I won't spoil anything, but I chose this movie because, out of all the films, it's the one that resonates with me the most as the main character finally finds a sense of family, which touched my heart. I give it a 10/10 rating and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys magic and fantasy.</b></i></td>

The film stars Noomi Rapace, Glenn Close, and Willem Dafoe. The film is set in a world where the population is rapidly increasing, leading to limited food resources. To control the population, the government enforces a one-child policy, with any additional children being taken away. However, a family manages to hide septuplets from the authorities, naming each child after a day of the week. As the septuplets grow up, one of them, Monday, begins to behave suspiciously, leading to a major plot twist. I highly recommend this film for its intriguing and unexpected storyline.

            <td class="text"><i><b>"Our Secret Diary" was released in 2023 and directed by Kentaro Takemura. Nozomi Kuroda (played by Hiyori Sakurada) is a high school sophomore who one day finds a letter with only the word "like" written on it. The letter is from Jun Setoyama (played by Fumiya Takahashi), the most popular boy in school. Despite her embarrassment, Nozomi ends up responding by leaving her answer in the school's shoe closet, starting a secret exchange diary between them. She later discovers that the intended recipient of the first letter was her best friend, but she finds herself drawn to Jun, who is more open with his thoughts and feelings than she is. Jun, however, can't bring himself to reveal that he's the one exchanging messages, not his best friend. The story is romantic, sweet, and cute, and the light-hearted school setting is perfect for fans of high school romance. Overall, I would rate this movie 10/10.</b></i></td>

            <td class="text"><i><b>"Even if this Love Disappears from the World Tonight" was released in 2022 and directed by Takahiro Miki. The movie tells the story of Toru Kamiya (played by Shunsuke Michieda) who, due to bullying from his classmate, makes a false confession to Maori Hino (played by Riko Fukumoto), 	    telling her that he likes her but setting rules for their relationship, one of which is not to fall in love with each other. Despite this, they start dating and have fun together. However, Toru breaks his own rule and falls in love with Maori. When he confesses his true feelings to her, she reveals that she is ill. Toru, who suffers from memory loss, starts keeping a diary to remember the happy moments with her. The movie has a heavy storyline but still feels romantic between the main characters. The ending is heart-wrenching and tear-jerking, so I recommend having tissues ready before watching. I would rate this movie 8/10.</b></i></td>
